## Project current status

###Functionality

All basic React components are defined,
connection with the API works (used axios)

Sorting filtering searching and toggling are in progress.
Having some trouble moving data between components, 
for testing of sorting, searching e.tc. you can use manually the filter methods in Gallery.js

###Appearence
